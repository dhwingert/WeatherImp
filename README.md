# WeatherImp

WeatherImp was intended to be a custom weather application for people who fly remote control airplanes.
The goal was to add the additional detailed info about wind that would help decide whether it was a good day to fly.

This is a work in progress.  The main purpose of this project was to teach myself Android programming.

This was based on a tutorial program called Sunshine.  I took it apart and add calls to a subscription weather service called AccuWeather.com
